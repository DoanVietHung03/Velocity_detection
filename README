THIS PROJECT IS ON FIXING PROCESS

There are 2 kind of testing:
1) With *.pkl and lane_mask image file:
- This *.pkl file contain all infor about lane segmentation, speed and distance measurement and lane_mask image file is an grouth truth image of lane segmentation to check accuracy of lane segmentation.
- Run calibration_tool.py to get all infor and save to config.py such as SOURCE_POINTS, TARGET_WIDTH, TARGET_HEIGHT, METERS_PER_PIXEL.
- Run main.py to test.

2) Without *.pkl and lane_mask image file:
- You have to know the real size of the road/lane to apply Bird's Eye View (use GG MAPS to get the real size of the road/lane).
- First, find 4 points of the road/lane on the video -> having SOURCE_POINTS 
- Second, config TARGET_WIDTH and TARGET_HEIGHT by yourself.
- Third, calculate METERS_PER_PIXEL using this formula: METERS_PER_PIXEL = real_size_of_the_road / number of pixels in TARGET_WIDTH
- Run main.py to test.
